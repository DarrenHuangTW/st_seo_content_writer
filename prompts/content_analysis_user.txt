Analyze the provided content below and generate a structured analysis report with the following sections.

## Provided Webpages

Example:
1. **On-Page Optimization** - Most sources emphasize the importance of proper keyword placement, meta descriptions, and header structure.

## Contradicting Viewpoints
List 2-3 contradicting viewpoints found among the provided content. For each:

2. **Keyword Density** - There are opposing views on optimal keyword density, with some sources recommending higher frequencies than others.

## Information Gaps

- Name the missing topic
- Explain in one sentence why this information would be valuable to someone searching for '{topic_query}'

Example:
1. **Industry-Specific Applications** - Readers would benefit from knowing how to adapt general SEO principles to their specific industry vertical.
